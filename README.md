# My personal blog

This is the source for my personal blog. I push it here and it's automatically compiled by [github pages](https://pages.github.com) using [jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages), and then it ends up at [blog.jobvranish.com](https://blog.jobvranish.com)

TODO:

- add photo, improve about
- add icons and improved formatting?


## To build locally with jekyll:

First install:
- direnv
- rbenv

First time setup:
```
direnv allow
bundle install
```

then

```
jekyll serve
```

then open [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
